# What's the weather like in Oahu, HI?

## Introduction
Hawaii is an archipelago of [volcanic islands](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hawaii.html) in the north Pacific Ocean. It is a popular tourist destination all year round. There are [eight main islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Hawaii): Hawai'i, Maui, Kaho'olawe, Lana'i, Moloka'i, O'ahu, Kaua'i, and Ni'ihau. O'ahu is the [third largest](https://traveltips.usatoday.com/8-large-islands-hawaii-108082.html) island in the archipelago and one with varied geographies. It features a plateau in between two parallel mountain ranges. [It is widely known](https://www.britannica.com/place/Oahu) for its place in modern military history, its tourism, and its pineapples. 
<br><br>
When is the best time to visit O'ahu? A factor that certainly contributes to one's decision is the weather. In this study, I explored the weather patterns (indicated by precipitation and temperature). A case study is presented in which the weather during my vacation there is indicated.

## Method
Daily weather data (precipitation and temperature) were obtained from these weather stations and stored in the  `hawaii.sqlite` database. This database consists of two tables: `Measurements` and `Stations`. The data was then reflected into Python ([version 3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/)) using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). Data was processed using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), and [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) modules. Data visualisation was  performed using [folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/docs-v0.5.0/modules.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) modules.

### Database date range
To determine the date range, the earliest date was retrieved from the database and then sorted in ascending order; the date of the latest record was also determined by retrieving the dates from the database and then sorting the dates in descending order.

```python
# Return the earliest date in the dataframe
Earliest_date = session.query(Measurement.date).order_by(Measurement.date.asc()).first()
first_date = Earliest_date[0]
first_date

# Return the latest date in the dataframe
Latest_date = session.query(Measurement.date).order_by(Measurement.date.desc()).first()
end_date = Latest_date[0]
end_date
```

The end date was a string. To determine the date from one year ago (365 days), the end date was converted to the datetime format. 

```python
# Calculate the date 1 year ago from the last data point in the database
year_ago = dt.date(int(end_date[0:4]), int(end_date[5:7]), int(end_date[8:11])) - dt.timedelta(days = 365)
start_date = str(year_ago)
start_date
```

### Weather station information
A query was created to determine the number of stations included in the database.

```python
# Design a query to show how many stations are available in this dataset 
no_stns = session.query(func.count(distinct(Measurement.station))).all()
```

Then, a database was generated by merging the `Measurements` and `Stations` tables.

```python
# Merge the measurement and the station tables based on station id
sel = [Measurement.station, Measurement.date, Measurement.prcp, Measurement.tobs,
       Station.name, Station.elevation, Station.latitude, Station.longitude]

same_stn = session.query(*sel).filter(Measurement.station == Station.station).all()

# Create a dataframe combining Measurement and Station data
df1 = pd.DataFrame(same_stn)
```

The ranges of temperatures and precipitation levels per weather station could be visualised using box plots.

```python
# Visualise the precipitation ranges per weather station
b = df1.boxplot(by="station", column = ["prcp"], figsize = (15,8))
plt.xticks(rotation = 90)
plt.xlabel("Station", fontsize = 16)
plt.ylabel("Precipitation (in)", fontsize = 16)
plt.ylim(-0.1,2)
plt.title("")
plt.suptitle("")
plt.tight_layout()

# Visualise the temperature ranges per weather station
b = df1.boxplot(by="station", column = ["tobs"], figsize = (15,8))
plt.xticks(rotation = 90)
plt.xlabel("Station", fontsize = 16)
plt.ylabel("Temperature (Â°F)", fontsize = 16)
plt.ylim(50,100)
plt.title("")
plt.suptitle("")
plt.tight_layout()
```

The data was then grouped by `station id` and the means of precipitation, `prcp`, and temperature, `tobs`, were calculated.

```python
# Get averages for precipitation and observed temperature
grouped_df1 = df1.groupby("station").mean()
grouped_df1 = grouped_df1.reset_index()
```

### Most active station
A new query was created to determine the most active among the nine stations.

```python
# Select the columns for the analyses
sel2 = [Measurement.station, func.count(Measurement.station)]

# What are the most active stations? (i.e. what stations have the most rows)?
stn_count = session.query(*sel2).group_by(Measurement.station).order_by(func.count(Measurement.station).desc()).all()

# Select the most active station (most number of measurements)
most_active_stn = stn_count[0][0]
```

### Weather data for the most active station
Once the most active station was identified, the precipitation and temperature summary statistics (minimum, maximum, and average) for this station was determined, covering the last year of the database's records.

```python
# Calculate the minimum, average, and maximum temperature and precipitation in the most active station in the last year on record
sel3 = [func.min(Measurement.prcp), func.avg(Measurement.prcp), func.max(Measurement.prcp), 
        func.min(Measurement.tobs), func.avg(Measurement.tobs), func.max(Measurement.tobs)]

summary_weather = session.query(*sel3).filter(Measurement.station == most_active_stn).\
filter(Measurement.date >= start_date).filter(Measurement.date <= end_date).all()

prcp_min = round(summary_weather[0][0], 1)
prcp_avg = round(summary_weather[0][1], 1)
prcp_max = round(summary_weather[0][2], 1)
temp_min = round(summary_weather[0][3], 1)
temp_avg = round(summary_weather[0][4], 1)
temp_max = round(summary_weather[0][5], 1)
```
