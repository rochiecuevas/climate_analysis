# What's the weather like in Oahu, HI?

## Introduction
Hawaii is an archipelago of volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is a popular tourist destination all year round. 
<br><br>
There are [eight main islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Hawaii): Hawai'i, Maui, Kaho'olawe, Lana'i, Moloka'i, O'ahu, Kaua'i, and Ni'ihau.
<br><br>
O'ahu is the third largest island in the archipelago and one with varied geographies. It is one of my favourite places to visit.
