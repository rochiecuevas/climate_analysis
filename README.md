# What's the weather like in Oahu, HI?

## Introduction
Hawaii is an archipelago of [volcanic islands](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hawaii.html) in the north Pacific Ocean. It is a popular tourist destination all year round. There are [eight main islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Hawaii): Hawai'i, Maui, Kaho'olawe, Lana'i, Moloka'i, O'ahu, Kaua'i, and Ni'ihau. O'ahu is the [third largest](https://traveltips.usatoday.com/8-large-islands-hawaii-108082.html) island in the archipelago and one with varied geographies. It features a plateau in between two parallel mountain ranges. [It is widely known](https://www.britannica.com/place/Oahu) for its place in modern military history, its tourism, and its pineapples. 
<br><br>
When is the best time to visit O'ahu? A factor that certainly contributes to one's decision is the weather. In this study, I explored the weather patterns (indicated by precipitation and temperature). A case study is presented in which the weather during my vacation there is indicated.
## Method
Data was obtained from nine weather stations located in the central, the eastern, and the southern parts of the island (Figure 1).

These stations are found in different elevations (Table 1). The weather station with the lowest elevation, Honolulu Observatory is located near Ewa Beach. On the other hand, the weather station with the highest elevation, Upper Wahiawa 874.3, is located in the plateau between the Waianae range (to the west) and the Koolau range (to the east). [These mountain ranges used to be shield volcanoes](https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/oahu/travel-info/maps).
